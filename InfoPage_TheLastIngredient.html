                The Last Ingredient, a short 3D animation, was created for giving an idea of the sacrifice. 
                The story is about fighting between a brave man and a mysterious creature. 
                The main purpose of the project was to convince the audience to appreciate to food that they consume.
            </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                This was the final animation thesis of my student life. It was created by my 2 friends and me. 
                According to this animation, you may notice that its duration is seriously short. 
                This is the result of our intention and fault. There was plenty of story along 5 months when we were making this thesis. 
                Certainly, our objectives were to deliver the best result from our 4 years learning, however, 
                we might think too much about creating the masterpiece. By trying to adapt lots of techniques and concepts on this work, 
                we could not handle with time effectively. Anyway, indeed, I was so proud of this journey. 
                We solved the problem and learned new techniques by ourselves. And finally, this is what we get from our college life.
