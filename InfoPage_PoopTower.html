                “Poop Tower” was my final project in a basic computer programming class, created by using ActionScript 3.0 in Adobe Flash. 
                The inspiration was from a mobile game which I was playing at that moment. I thought that I would like to make a game like this. 
                Its logic seemed a bit complex, hence it challenged me well. According to the game concept, 
                the player had to destroy the poop tower as much as he could within the limit duration, however, please beware your head, 
                because a huge amount of shit was falling down to you. The difficult point of its code was graphic because there was some part of the game mechanic 
                that cooperated with lots of graphics displaying.
