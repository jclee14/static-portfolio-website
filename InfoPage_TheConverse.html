                Everyone has his way. The way leads to the goals, and we follow it with our mind and feeling. 
                On the converse side, we often escape from the path which we are walking. 
                Running from the destination that does not to stop. Vit, a fat calm man, 
                decided to travel to Hatyai for finding his unfamiliar father who left his family behind 
                and telling him important news that may revive their bond again.
            </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The Converse is a short film project which was produced in my film-making class. 
                Luckily, my production has experienced members in various branches, except actor, 
                hence they turned back to me who had ever been an actor in some projects before. 
                At that time, I was really tired, because our production moved in numerous location. 
                Our scenes were shot from day to night. Someday, we slept in the next morning. 
                Although there were many events came to me at this moment, but they were precious experiences 
                that taught me lots of lessons from production to life principles.
