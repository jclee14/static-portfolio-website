                Robo is being thirsty. Robo is moving. Robo is going to find some engine oil. "Robobobobobobbobobo - - - #!!!"
            </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                This extreme short animation project was created for animation competition, The Style Moving Challenge, 
                while I was being a trainee at Yggdrazil Studio. The contest was looking for animation artists 
                to join their real-time animation battle, hence we submitted this project for registering. 
                I remembered that my team and I had spent only 5 days for finishing this robotic animation. 
                Luckily, one of the trainees who came from Rangsit University, assisted us by simulating oil particle 
                which we could not do at that time, hence his magic made this animation became alive. 
                At last, we were selected into the mentioned competition.
