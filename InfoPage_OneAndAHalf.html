                One and a Half, the story of two friends who are eating some yummy ice cream! Unfortunately, one of them drops his pop. What should they do?
            </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                A short animation for kids which was created during my intern in Bangkok with my friends for competition purpose. 
                The rule of this contest is to make any kind of media which educate and support kids to have good manners. 
                We decided to serve a short 3D animation that was easy to watch and understand in a short duration. 
                The most challenge obstacle of this project was all of the artists worked at the different places, 
                hence we talked and transferred resources frequently. At the end of the competition, we got an outstanding prize (2nd place). 
                But no one wins the first position, hence it was clear that we were not good enough for that award.
