                The story about the relationship between two astronauts who undergo through a bad situation which threatens their bond.
            </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The first project which I cooperated with juniors in my college. The main purpose is to join the animation festival, DigiCon6 Asia 18th. 
                The festival which was established by a Japanese organization for promoting an animation community on an international level. 
                Because most of my teammates never do any 3D animation in full production, hence we had to work harder and focus on communication well. 
                Some of the members were skillful drawing, thus this was an important opportunity to adapt self-painted texture technique on the whole surface. 
                The projectâ€™s picture was enhanced quality. At last, our animation was received the audience award. 
                As a representative, I flew to Tokyo to join the festival ceremony and presented this work to international artists.
