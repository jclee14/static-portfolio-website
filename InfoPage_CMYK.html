                The growing of PSUIC in the technology industry is very outstanding in others' eyes. 
                To know how they success, CMYK force is ordered to take the information from PSUIC staffs 
                by using their professional digital media skills and equipment.

                Back to my summer in 2014, my advisor suggested my teammates and I produced some media for promoting our college, 
                moreover developing our hard skills. Determinedly, we accepted this challenge with energetic thoughts. 
                Coincidentally, I had watched some references about sci-fi video, hence we decided to make this promoting film 
                by adopting sci-fi concepts in it. This was really humorous, we put lots of jokes and visual effects on this film, 
                but this project was not successful because of my storiesâ€™ sequence. Anyway, this was evidence of the distance we walked from that point.
