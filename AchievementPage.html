                        In addition, we practiced both from class and outside, especially from tutorials and interning, and we loved to join the competition, our objective is to develop ourselves.

                        However, sometimes, too much on something did not work. On the last day, I learn an important lesson from my senior

                        collaboration with this international institute, hence they gave my classmates and me a precious chance to travel to Kuala Lumpur, 
                        and join this festival as an invited artist. In addition, there were other artists from China and Indonesia. 
                        I was very excited because most of the projects in this showcase were interactive media. Their media was integrated with their own culture, and attitude then delivered an innovation 
                        that was a solution to their social problem. This event inspired me beyond.</p>

                        We dealt with lots of problems, planned huge things to do, and spent our time and strength on this last project. 
                        Everything was going well. 
                        We received both positive feedback and suggestion. Of cause, the main purpose was to present our unknown works and institute 
                        to an outside audience, but this meant more. I was really grateful for our teamwork, especially my juniors. It was a long day

                        At first, because our juniors did not know the processes of animation making, hence we had to work harder. At that moment, 
                        I acted as a team leader, so this gained my pressure as well. Finally, we got an audience award! 
                        In addition, I got an opportunity to be a representative of our team to join the ceremony in Tokyo, Japan.

                        hence we discussed together for establishing our team again, and working in our hometown as a freelance studio under 
                        the name "TIX3 Studio". Our studio mainly worked in video and animation field according to our skills. Unfortunately, 
                        TIX3 stood for 6 months. There was something new we would like to learn and try, hence it was better to make this decision. 
                        Anyway, this period gave me lots of experiences. I was pushed to face with a real client and hard situation, not the lecturer anymore. 
                        We managed our timeline under an estimated budget and scope. From Wedding presentation, Surprise proposal, to dental animation, 
                        they extremely challenged us.</p>

                        Back to the beginning, one of my close friends dreamt to create his own product. Coincidentally, there was a food trend occurred 
                        in Singapore. Salted egg was really insanely popular. Every menu, from fried chicken to ice cream, in this town, was flavored and 
                        seasoned by salted egg. In addition, salted egg flavored snack was very successful, thus my mentioned friend intent to adopt this 
                        viral to his brand. He asked me and others to join this project. By assisting from university researchers, we made a salted egg product. 
                        It was a tough time because we did not have any production knowledge, hence the best thing that we could support the researcher 
                        was brand image and design. Finally, this project was disbanded for some reasons, but I did not regret what I had done. 
                        Although it did not achieve, It was really funny and priceless memories. We flew to Singapore for talks with the salted egg product owner, 
                        drove to Bangkok for selling our product in a food festival, and traveling to Surat-Thani for visiting duck farm.</p>

                        I stayed with Chatthong for 4 months. Responsibilities under my scope were supporting the marketing staffs and house sellers both in 
                        general job and media content creator. I gained important knowledge and experience from this place. I acted like a normal staff,

                        our imagination. The challenge was about problem-solving. We had to design the solution for each mission, hence it was harder 
                        than just designing, but it was better. Our idea did not frame from any judges or rules. At the end of that day, we got the

                        and adapt to designing an innovation. I was very tense and excited at the same time. In conclusion, my team missed the prizes.
